## Article I Found Interesting

https://en.chessbase.com/post/can-artificial-intelligence-identify-your-playing-style

I thought that this article was very interesting, it discusses a team of computer scientists at University of Toronto who created software which analyzes chess games from Lichess, and is able to recognize individual players playing style. Once having analyzed a certain players games it was able to later recognize that player just by seeing one of their games over 86% of the time.

I thought this was incredible, as tailoring chess AI to be better suited to human playing styles has been a topic of much discussion in the chess world and this seems like it could be a step forward. Given that the top chess engines today play perfectly relative to even the best humans, the best lines in different chess positions can be incredibly difficult to memorize, and mostly assume the opponent will find the best response (which is often not true of humans). The technology discussed in this article could help pave the way for chess engines which can suggest lines which work best against other players past playing habits, and could change the preparation work needed at the top level of chess.

I too found this article interesting, and I think it is a step forward in the development of chess AI. It was also very interesting to me to know that a human has actually not beaten a chess AI in over 15 years, and that the chess AI is still in the process of being developed. So as time goes by these algorithms will become even more advanced to test the limits of human performance.
